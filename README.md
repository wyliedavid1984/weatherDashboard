# WeatherDashboard

## Description

Our assignment was to create a weather application.  If the user puts in a city in the US, it will give both the daily forecast as well as the five day. The daily has the name of the city listed. The next part of daily forecast is an icon displaying what the weather will be like.  The temp is displayed in both fahrenheit and celsius. Daily then display what the humidity level will be that day.  Wind speed is next in the display.  Then the last item displayed is UV index that will display both the index as a value and a color to show the where on the index that lies.  Green, yellow, orange, red, and purple are the different level that will be displayed from lowest to highest.  In the the five day shows us the date, an icon, temp and humidity.  The search bar will create buttons to go back to previous links if the user decides to revisit a searched  city.  Upon reload, it will use the very last city searched/ the city at the top of the button list as the current.  If the user want to clear out the city buttons there is also a clear button.
